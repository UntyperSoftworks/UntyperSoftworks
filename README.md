# Untyper's Readme
> ignore this readme, still wip

👋 Hey everyone!

My name is Noah Yang (my online alias, [_Untyper_](https://roblox.com/profile?username=Untyper))
and I've been a programmer for more than **4 years** currently.

I've been learning **[Luau](https://luau.org)** for most of my programming,
but I've been able to learn other langauges such as **JavaScript** and **Java**.
I mostly play and develop scripts on **Roblox**, hence why I mostly use Luau.

In fact, I also made **Roblox exploits** that were a bit too overpowered.
You can check some of them out inside the **[Code Archives](https://github.com/UntyperSoftworks/CodeArchives)**
in [`RobloxCheats`](https://github.com/UntyperSoftworks/CodeArchives/tree/main/RobloxCheats).
Right now, I'm currently developing a newer (and much more optimized) roblox script, **[Outrage](https://github.com/outrageroblox)**.

Here are some stuff that I've made (on Roblox):
> todo: add videos/images of said stuff
